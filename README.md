# ft_ls-checker

A test runner for the ft_ls project at 42.

To use it, just run the set of test you want, or all_test.sh if you want to test them all, and give the path of your ft_ls
as the first argument.

If you want to print the differences between your output and ls output just add the letter 'p' as the second arg.
