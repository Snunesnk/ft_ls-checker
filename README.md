# ft_ls-checker

### A test runner for 42's ft_ls project.

To use it, just run the set of test you want, or `all_test.sh` if you want to test them all, and give the path of your `ft_ls`
as first argument.
`./all_test.sh path/to/your/ft_ls`

If you want to print the differences between your output and `ls` output just add the letter `p` as second argument.
`./basic_test.sh path/to/your/ft_ls p`
